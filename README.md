# Project for the course: "getting and cleaning data" 

## Intro

We must read and merge two datasets so that we can create another dataset
with average of variable/activity/subject

## Original data

There are 561 features, a.k.a. variables, listed in "features.txt"

There are two sets of data: "train/X_train.txt" and "test/X_test.txt", they have 561 columns, described in the feature list

Every experiment, that is a row, involved a subject, listed in "subject_[test|train].txt", making an activity, listed in "y_[test|train].txt"
